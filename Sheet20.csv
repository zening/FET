"All PERCOW applications from external and or Third Party clients will be required to pay an As-Built Drawing Retention Bond (“Bond”) for the receipt of As-Built Drawings. The cheque is to be made payable to Melbourne Airport.
The As-Built drawings are to be submitted together with an As Built drawing Checklist APPENDIX G – AS – BUILT DRAWING CHECKLIST .
 All documents are to be forwarded to the Melbourne Airport Building Approvals Officer. The As Built drawings are to be supplied on a disc only (emails are not acceptable). A transmittal notice should accompany the As Built drawings and indicate the PERCOW file number and a list of all drawings that have been supplied, together with their titles and drawing file numbers.
Melbourne Airport will now accept the As Built drawings in Auto CAD format, however the drawings will still require converting to Microstation V8 and to the MA CAD standard. This will be done at a cost to the applicant / company responsible for the production of the As Builts.
(“Conversion fees”)
These conversion fees will be deducted from the Bond paid prior to the issue of PERCOW. Any amount of the Bond remaining after the deduction of the conversion fees will be refunded to the applicant / company that paid the Bond. If the amount to convert the supplied As Builts exceeds the Bond amount, the applicant / company will be invoiced for the outstanding fees due.  If the As Built drawings are supplied in the Microstation V8 format to the MA CAD standard, www.mel.com.au/extranet/cad. and require no alteration the full Bond will be returned after advice from MA that the As Builts have been accepted. The applicant / company will then need to supply MA with an invoice requesting the return of the fees paid. This invoice will require that the MEL ***** or MIS ***** job number be quoted, along with a brief description of works. Also quote the fee & GST component paid.  For example: Amount Issued $2272.73 + GST 10% $227.27 Total Due $2500.00",,,,,,,,,,,=M11+1,900000,=O12*(1/1.1),4500
